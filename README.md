# robots.txt.files
Robots TXT files and other bits for keeping things out of your sites.

There are two versions, the content of which is exactly the same.  The only difference is the comments.

**Nasty** has some rather mean-spirited comments for the bots that have been the bane of my server's existence.

**Nice** still has a rude word or two, but is far more polite about telling these bots to 'bugger off'.

Both will be maintained with the latest bot lists from sources (to be added here), as well as any I discover in independent research.

### DisallowAITraining
Added this extension to the robots.txt files, along with the catch-all option for any new AI robots as yet unlisted.

> Microsoft has proposed an experimental extension to the Robots Exclusion Protocol, introducing a new directive, DisallowAITraining. This directive is designed to prevent AI crawlers from using public web content for training purposes. It simplifies the process by allowing publishers to block all AI training crawlers with a single rule. As part of a broader effort to enhance control over content usage, this directive aligns with ongoing industry discussions and aims to standardize protections against unauthorized AI data collection.
